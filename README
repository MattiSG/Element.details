A pure JS polyfill for <details> tag with DOM API for all browsers including IE6+
IMPORTANT:: IE6 and IE7 support is not finished yet

DOM API:
var details = document.querySelector("details");
details.open = true;
details.open = false;

CSS selector for 'details marker':
summary .details-marker,/* <-- */
summary::-webkit-details-marker
[,summary::-moz-details-marker]
[,summary::-o-details-marker]
,summary::details-marker { <some> }

Features:
- Extend HTMLElement.prototype with "open" property
- No libs need (almost)
- DOM API
- Create <x-s> element (instead of fake <summary> which can be styled in css) when <details> without <summary>
- Wrap text nodes into custom element <x-i> instead of <span> (which can be styled in css)
- IE6 and IE7 support with some tweaks

Limitations:
No animation support for now

Browser support:
With any DOM and JS shim: all browsers (including IE8+)
IE6+ only with this DOM/JS shim: https://github.com/termi1uc1/ES5-DOM-SHIM and with "Element.details.ielt8.htc" file in the root of youre site (or you can solve Same Domain *.htc Limitation [RUS]-> https://github.com/termi1uc1/ES5-DOM-SHIM/blob/master/extra/SameDomainLimitation.SOLVE_RUS.odt?raw=true)

TODO:
1. Listeners (open/close)
2. Custom <x-i> element with "details-marker" class instead of "details>summary::before" for details marker purpose
3. Code refactoring/minimising
4. "root" in init() support
5. External API for init() function

A pure JS polyfill for <details> tag with DOM API for all browsers including IE6+

DOM API:
details.open = true;
details.open = false;

Features:
- No libs need (almost)
- DOM API
- No extended API
- Create <x-summary> element (instead of fake <summary> which can be styled in css) when <details> without <summary>
- Wrap text nodes into custom element <x-i> instead of <span> (which can be styled in css)

Limitations:
No animation support for now

Browser support:
With any DOM and JS shim: all browsers (including IE8+)
IE6+ only with this DOM/JS shim: https://github.com/termi1uc1/ES5-DOM-SHIM

TODO:
1. Listeners (open/close)
2. Custom <x-i> element with "details-marker" class instead of "details>summary::before" for details marker purpose
3. Code refactoring/minimising
4. "root" support
5. External API for init() function
